# Soulful ART üé®

**Soulful ART** is a modern MERN stack e-commerce platform dedicated to connecting art lovers with original paintings and unique art pieces. Our vision is to create a vibrant marketplace where users can **buy pre-made art, request custom pieces**, and **artists can sell their creations, host auctions, and offer on-demand art services**. We aim to be the go-to destination for authentic, soul-stirring art.
